Are you looking for the WLED software for WS2812B LEDs? [Go here!](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED)!

## Welcome to WLED-squared! (PRE ALPHA DEV 0.1.0 version)

WLED fork with adapted driver to drive PxMatrix RGB led matrices.
This project is currently still in the stage of my personal testing, which means I will NOT provide any support yet.
Many values are hardcoded and there are a log of bugs and instabilities.

WLED-squared will also support WS2812B matrices in the future.

### Features:
- All WLED effects (some broken) get mapped to the edge of the display
- Frame or Heart shape selectable (mobile UI ONLY)
- Full 2D spectrum analyzer effect in realtime mode

### Temporary Limitations:
- Some of bugs and flickering
- ESP8266 with enough pins only
- 64x32 matrix only (smaller settable in code)

### Supported light control interfaces:
- All supported by WLED

### Quick start guide and documentation:

I'd recommend waiting until this project is in a more polished state. For now, check out [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED)!

Most of the WLED doc applies to WLED-squared as well: [wiki](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki)
